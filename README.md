# Myspace

2007 Myspace was a special place in my life. Short of embedding Green Day's _Boulevard of Broken Dreams_ for the profile song, I have resurrected my old Myspace.

I used markup and styles extracted from an actual archived copy of Myspace Tom's profile (thanks Tom!). Original details used, except for the layout — instead of HTML tables I used CSS Grid.
